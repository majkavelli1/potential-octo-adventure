            Does she need to be an empathetic leader? Ask about that. Does she need to take your comp any public? Ask about that. Ifyou're the candidate, talk about why you took certain jobs. Explain why you left. Explain why you chose a certain school. Share why
            you decided to go to grad school. Di scuss why you took a year offto backpack through Europe, and what you got out of the experience. What are your biggest weaknesses? Every candidate knows how to answer this question: Just pick a theoretical
            weakness and magically transform that flaw into a strength in disgui sel For example: "My biggest weakness is getting so absorbed in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone has gone home! I know I should
            be more aware ofthe clock, but when I love what I'm doing I just can't think of anything else." So your "biggest weakness" is that you'll put in more hours than everyone else? Great. What are your biggest strengths? I'm not sure why interviewers
            ask this question; your resume and experience should make your strengths readily apparent! Even so, ifyou're asked, provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precisel Ifyou're a great problem solver, don't just say that: Provide a few
            examples, pertinent to the opening, that prove you're a great problem solver! If you're an emotionaly intelli gent leader, don't just say that!
